# General Biz
I am a Test Developer and Release Manager at Younique Products. I create automated testing for our warehouse and inventory systems, help out with some front and back-end development, while also managing our code repositories and releasing daily regression. 

When I am not working or coding, I am usually playing an instrument, playing a video game, or spending time with my Wife. No kids, but we have an awesome dog named Apollo.

# JavaScript Experience
In my current professional role, I have become very familiar with Selenium, Webdriverio, and Node. I have been able to create an expansive test suite that covers a lot of our current testing needs, and am working to keep expanding the value those tests give with deeper verification and confirmation of system integrity.

However, I am no expert. Test Developing has given me a lot of great experience and a taste of what is to come. This type of development doesn't always require an expansive knowledge of JavaScript and programming in general. I am looking forward to honing my skills and continue growing as a Web Developer and getting to learn a deeping understanding of development.

My favorite part of web development has to be the problem solving, and all the ways it can be done. Even when creating this blog, I had an almost endless amount of methods to go about getting this live. I also love learning new things, and this field certainly has a demand in being able to continuously learn.

# What I Hope to Learn
In this class, I am excited to learn more about JavaScript and Node. I am looking forward to creating better and more useful apps. Mostly though, I am excited to get outside of my comfort zone. I think the best learning for me has been when I jump into new tools and methods of development without thinking about it too much. I feel that I have a great foundation and am excited to keep growing.

At the end of the semester, I want to have a deeper understanding of development and add more to my tool belt to become a more valuable developer.
