# What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, and helps fill in features where JS usually fails to deliver. JavaScript is a loosely typed language, and unlike other languages you don't initialize your variables with a type of data that it should represent. TypeScript comes in to save the day and allows you to keep all the functionality of JavaScript, while being able to define types and set schematics for data structures and functions.

#### How is it helpful?
TypeScript helps developers by giving an extra layer of validation when coding. When you are able to confidently assume your variables and data that is being worked with is in the correct form, you can spend less time wondering where it all went wrong. TypeScript gives real time verification that your code is doing what you expect it to. 

#### Difference between compiled and transpiled code?
When code is compiled, source code is taken from the language it was written in and transformed into another language. For example, c# is taken from what it was originally written in, and compiled into Common Intermediate Language while it is being read by an operating system. Transpiled code is taken from it's original source code and then rewritten into a similar form. TypeScript source code is transpiled into regular JavaScript. So while TypeScript is written, the code that the browser will actually read is regular JavaScript.
