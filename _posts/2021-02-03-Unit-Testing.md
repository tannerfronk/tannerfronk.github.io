# What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing is taking your code and testing all of it's different functionality. It is used to determine the integrity of functions in a codebase and if they are useable. The "unit" in unit testing can be an one function, a class, or even one line of code. You're just testing different "units" of the code you're working with.

Test Driven Development uses unit testing to guide the process of development. Creating test cases before you even start creating the functions they will look at. Test Driven Development (TDD) is a great practice to take on to assure more quality with your code from inception. TDD can help you catch edge cases or minor issues that may come up later as your codebase grows. By directly testing functionality while it is being created, the large issues appear very quickly and will save you time and resources in the long run because you already subjected your code to the QA process. 

TDD isn't perfect, however. You can't think of everything, and inevitable issues will pop up if the uses of your code grow over time. TDD also can take more time initially when developing systems, and the tests themselves need to be maintained as the code changes. It is a lot more upkeep, but the positives outweigh the negatives if you adopt the process early on as it can save loads of time in the future fixing major bugs and issues.
