<p>NPM stands for Nighttime Pachinko Marathon. Or at least, that is what npmjs.com just told me. What it <em>really</em> stands for is Node Package Manager. NPM is a great tool that allows the easy distrubtion of packages that can be useful for different kinds of projects. Instead of having to download a folder, unpack the files in a specific place and waste a lot of time, you can just install it directly into your projects directory via the command line. You can even install multiple packages at once by separating package names by a space. This is how simple it is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm i &lt;package name&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="what-is-an-npm-module">What is an NPM Module?</h4>

<p>NPM Modules is really just a fancy way of saying NPM package, like I did above. It is the specific module, or package, that you download via NPM. My most used NPM module is probably Less.js, which is a CSS preprocessor. There are thousands of them, and anyone can create and share them to NPM.</p>

<h4 id="the-3-components-of-npm">The 3 Components of NPM</h4>

<p>There are 3 main parts that make up NPM. The Node CLI, the NPM website, and the NPM registry. The CLI is how you interact directly with NPM and itâ€™s modules. The website can be used to search packages and learn more about the ones you want to find. The NPM registry is what the website indexes, and is what directs your downloads to the GitHub repositories for each module.</p>
